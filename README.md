# Automate-Google-Forms
This python module will automate the google forms. With this module we can fill the fields of google form  with responses by file handling. Mechanize module is used to automate the process. Multithreading is used for better and faster execution.
### Aim
The aim is to make the google form automated so that one user can fill upto 500 responses in google form in just 3 minutes.
I have tested the code for 125 responses in 71 seconds.
